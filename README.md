Project for HackMIT 2017
Team members: Stephanie Hu, Sarah Wu, Charleen Wang. 

This web application extracts information from a photo of a flyer and creates a new Google Calendar event. It was 
built for HackMIT 2017 as a proof-of-concept, though we are planning to expand and refine the backend, as well as 
improve the user interface.
